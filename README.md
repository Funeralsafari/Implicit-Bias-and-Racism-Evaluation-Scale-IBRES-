This questionnaire aims to gauge someone's proneness to aversive or symbolic racism. At the end of the questionnaire.

                                      --------------------------------------
When you are done, your score will be tallied and it will provide a general interpretation based on the total score from the questionnaire. Here's an example of how it might interpret a given score:

Total Score: 75
Interpretation: "Possible indication of aversive or symbolic racism." (Score is above 60)
Total Score: 45
Interpretation: "Moderate indication of aversive or symbolic racism." (Score is between 40 and 60)
Total Score: 30
Interpretation: "Low indication of aversive or symbolic racism." (Score is below 40)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each general interpretation, we'll use specific categories from the questionnaire to illustrate how this function might provide insights based on average responses in each category. Let's assume we have the following categories:

Comfort in Multicultural Settings
Awareness of Racial Dynamics
Perception of Stereotypes
Views on Systemic Racism

Here's an example of how the analysis might look for each category:

Comfort in Multicultural Settings

Average Response: 4.2
Analysis: "You tend to have a more accepting or positive view in 'Comfort in Multicultural Settings'."

It's important to note that accurately gauging someone's propensity for aversive or symbolic racism can be complex. 
This test does not gauge on whether you are or aren't racist, but it instead gives insight to what you may be more prone to be susceptible to given certain situations. 
This test is about awareness, and is not to be used to judge, bully, or harm anyone. Racism is learned and can be unlearned. Education and informing people is key to lessening the hold racism has on them. 

This is recommended to be taken privately to avoid any potential judgement and for honesty. 

If this test is taken with others, I am not responsible for how others react.

Each time the test is taken it will provide an excel sheet of your responses.
