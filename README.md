When you are done, your score will be tallied and it will provide a general interpretation based on the total score from the questionnaire. Here's an example of how it might interpret a given score:

Total Score: 75
Interpretation: "Possible indication of aversive or symbolic racism." (Score is above 60)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each general interpretation, we'll use specific categories from the questionnaire to illustrate how this function might provide insights based on average responses in each category. Let's assume we have the following categories:

Comfort in Multicultural Settings, 
Awareness of Racial Dynamics, 
Perception of Stereotypes, 
Views on Systemic Racism, 

Here's an example of how the analysis might look for each category:

Comfort in Multicultural Settings

Average Response: 4.2
Analysis: "You tend to have a more accepting or positive view in 'Comfort in Multicultural Settings'."

It's important to note that accurately gauging someone's propensity for aversive or symbolic racism can be complex. 
This test does not gauge on whether you are or aren't racist, but it instead gives insight into whether you may be be susceptible to aversive or symbolic racism.
This test is about awareness, and is not to be used to judge, bully, or harm anyone. Racism is learned and can be unlearned. Education and informing people is key to lessening the hold racism has on them. 

This is recommended to be taken privately to avoid any potential judgement and for honesty. 

If this test is taken with others, I am not responsible for how others react.

Definitions:
-----------
Aversive Racism: This form of racism is subtle and often unconscious. It's characterized by aversions to racial minorities, despite endorsing equality and diversity. Questions about comfort in multicultural settings, reactions to racial jokes, and comfort discussing race with people of different races can particularly highlight aversive racism tendencies.

Symbolic Racism: This type of racism involves holding negative beliefs about a racial group based on perceived moral failings, such as a lack of work ethic or over-reliance on government assistance. Questions about beliefs in equal opportunities, views on systemic racism, and perceptions about crime and race can help uncover these attitudes.
